## Cub3d

The goal of the cub3d is to simulate a 3D environment like Wolfenstein 3D using raycasting. This project is written in c using mini-libx library. 

Implemented features: 4 different wall textures, according to the direction (present in ``inc/``), forward and back movement + rotation.

### Usage

./cub3D <map.cub>
